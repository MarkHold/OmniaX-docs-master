Here we can see and customize the colors of every part of the process viewier. At the buttom we can see a button with a checkmar box that is called Custom Process Style, which is a functionality that allows us to easily customize each process individually as seen in the example down below:

Once we click on the magic wand of the process that we would like to style, a process styling pop-up will be revealed. It allows the user to change the background color of the process, the text color and the size of the process component. The pop-up also contains an option that is called advanced mode, which allows the user to do all that was previously mentioned, but in CSS-code.
